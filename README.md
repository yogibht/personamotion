// TODO:
add a way to download brainjs neural map as a dataurl image.
feed said image to llm for insights
use example ccdiksolver from three to see how to implement it
ask llms to figure out how to feed all user data into brainjs and also create a system to use these user data and heatmap to get insight from llm
add a minimizer on the top right that will only show brainvz and then when clickit will go back to maximized state
Update readme to include info that this was mostly made my AI services with human asisstant.
